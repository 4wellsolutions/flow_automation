Environment: The Hollow Earth access point beneath Hong Kong.
Action: The sonic frequency hits the energy stream. It doesn't stop it; it severs Ghidorah's control. The raw, untamed power of the planet, now free of its cosmic leash, needs a new conduit. It whips around and, instead of flowing into Ghidorah, surges violently into the closest terrestrial Alpha: the fallen King Kong.
Mood/Expression: Shocking, unpredictable, a sudden reversal of fortune.
