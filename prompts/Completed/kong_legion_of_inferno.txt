**Character & Action:** Kong stands tall, not in triumph, but in exhaustion. He surveys the devastation he fought in, his expression grim and weary. He is scarred and battered, but he is unbroken. He has won, but the cost is written all over him and the world around him.
**Mood/Expression:** Somber victory, sacrifice, and the image of a lonely, weary guardian.
**Audio:** The quiet, awestruck whispers of the survivors. The sound of Kong's deep, tired breathing. The mournful and respectful theme of the victor plays softly.

Scene 90: Kong climbs a blackened ridge at sunrise, looking over a scarred Pacific Rim—the last Brute ember fades beneath the ash as the King stands victorious.

**Scene Title:** Sunrise on a Broken World
**Camera Style:** An epic, majestic crane shot that starts on a close-up of Kong's weary face and slowly pulls back and up, revealing the vast, scarred landscape of the Pacific Rim under the rising sun. The final shot is a breathtaking panorama of the King and his broken kingdom.
**Environment:** A blackened, volcanic ridge at sunrise. The new sun casts long shadows across a world of ash and cooled lava. Below, the last glowing ember in a fallen Brute's eye socket finally fades to black.

**Mood/Expression:** Melancholy triumph, enduring guardianship, and a new, scarred dawn. The war is over, but the world is forever changed.
**Audio:** A powerful, emotionally soaring orchestral score that combines Kong's heroic theme with a more somber, reflective melody. The final sound is the soft whisper of wind over the ridge as the last ember dies with a faint, fading sizzle.
