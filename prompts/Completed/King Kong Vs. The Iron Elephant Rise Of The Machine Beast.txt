Character: King Kong, the heroic Giant Ape, protector of humanity. His face is a mask of pure, unyielding defiance and righteous fury.
Environment: The burning city. The fires of destruction are reflected in his eyes.
Action: Kong throws his head back and unleashes a roar not of a beast, but of a king. It is a roar of defiance against the unending cycle of destruction, a roar of pain for the sacrifices made, and a roar of promise to the tiny humans cowering behind him. It is the roar of a true protector, echoing into the uncertain future. The screen cuts to black on the roar's crescendo.
Mood/Expression: Defiant, triumphant, and eternal. A final, legendary statement of heroism.
Audio: The most powerful, emotionally resonant, and earth-shattering ROOOOOOAAAAARRR of the entire film. It is layered with the heroic musical score, creating a sound that is both animalistic and divine. The sound continues for a second after the screen goes black.
Style of Video: Hyper-realistic, 8K, cinematic 'hero-shot' finale. The VFX on Kong's facial muscles, the spray from his mouth, and the sheer force of the roar should be breathtaking.
