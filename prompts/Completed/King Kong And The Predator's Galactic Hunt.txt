Character: King Kong (Colossal, his matted dark fur streaked with grey and crisscrossed with old, deep scars. His eyes hold a deep, ancient intelligence and weariness.)
Environment: The Hollow Earth. A vast cavern illuminated by a glowing, internal sun. Crystalline mountains pierce a ceiling of swirling energy.
Action: Kong is on all fours, his knuckles digging into the mossy earth. He lifts his head, sniffing the air, his brow furrowed. He lets out a low, guttural growl, not of anger, but of deep unease. His gaze is fixed on the crystalline ceiling, as if staring into the cosmos beyond.
Mood/Expression: Primal intuition, a king sensing a deep-rooted threat to his domain.
Audio: The ambient sounds of the Hollow Earth's mega-fauna. Kong's low, chest-rattling growl. The faint, almost subliminal hum of the cosmic frequency is present here too, a dissonant note in the natural harmony.
Style of Video: Cinematic, epic scale, 8K. The lighting from the Hollow Earth sun should cast dramatic shadows across Kong's features.

Character: King Kong (Colossal, his matted dark fur streaked with grey and crisscrossed with old, deep scars. His eyes hold a deep, ancient intelligence and weariness.)
Environment: The vibrant, alien landscape of the Hollow Earth.
Action: Kong rises to his full height. He takes a deep breath, his chest expanding like a mountain. He unleashes a deafening roar directly at the ceiling. It is not a roar of challenge, but a roar of *response*. A sound wave, visible as a distortion in the air, blasts upwards, causing the glowing crystals in the ceiling to resonate and flash brightly.
Mood/Expression: Instinctual defiance. A guardian answering a threat only he can perceive.
Audio: The full, world-shaking power of Kong's roar, echoing through the vast cavern. It briefly overpowers the dissonant cosmic hum.
Style of Video: Epic, cinematic, 8K. The visual effect of the sound wave and the resonating crystals is the focus.

Scene 6 — The Arrival
Camera Style: A silent, majestic, slow pan across the blackness of space.
Character: (None)
Environment: High Earth orbit. The planet hangs below like a blue marble.
Action: Three points of light shimmer into existence, resolving into ships. They are not metal, but seem carved from a black, obsidian-like material, covered in ornate, golden etchings of a three-headed dragon. They are shaped like brutalist cathedrals, all sharp angles and menacing spires. They de-cloak with a silent, oily ripple in spacetime.
Mood/Expression: Holy terror, silent and absolute menace. The arrival of something ancient and implacable.
Audio: Absolute silence.
Style of Video: Cinematic, photorealistic, 8K, '2001: A Space Odyssey' level of majestic dread.

Environment: A dense, steaming jungle on Skull Island, just outside the Monarch perimeter fence.
Action: Three Predators land simultaneously with a heavy, yet silent THUD. They don't land from a ship, but seem to shimmer into existence from a personal cloaking field. They rise to their full height, surveying the Monarch base. One of them, Yeyinde, tilts his head, his mask tracking the human movements with disinterest.
Mood/Expression: Supernatural assassins. They are not hunting; they are on a divine mission.
Audio: A heavy THUMP as they land, followed by the hiss of their cloaking fields deactivating. The ambient sounds of the jungle seem to fall silent in their presence.

Audio: Ka'il-Jah's translated sermon: "For eons, we have followed the World-Singer's glorious hymn. It purges the weak and summons the great hunt. Your world was to be blessed. But this beast... its defiant roar is cacophony. It is blasphemy against the Golden Demise."
