**Character:** Dr. Evelyn Sharpe: A woman in her late 30s with a sharp, bird-like intensity. She has a slender, almost frail build, but carries herself with a rigid, obsessive focus that makes her seem formidable. Her face is angular, with high cheekbones and a pointed chin, framed by dark, unruly hair often tied back in a messy but functional knot, with stray strands escaping to frame her face. Her most striking feature is her eyes—a piercing, intelligent grey, wide and unblinking behind thin-framed glasses, constantly analyzing and processing everything around her. She wears practical, high-end lab attire: a dark turtleneck sweater under a pristine white lab coat, its pockets bulging with data pads and pens. Her posture is perpetually hunched forward, as if leaning into her work, and her hands are always moving—gesturing, typing on a holographic interface, or nervously adjusting her glasses.
**Environment:** A sterile, brightly lit mobile genetics lab set up near the dig site. Metallic surfaces gleam. Vials and holographic displays are everywhere. The only light source is the cool blue glow of the equipment.

Its form is a terrifying fusion of impossible size and predatory grace. Its fur is a uniform, light-absorbing pitch black, so dark it appears as a void in the night, with no markings or variations. Its body is lean but powerfully muscled, built for explosive speed, with elongated limbs ending in massive paws tipped with obsidian-black claws capable of shredding steel. Its head is lupine but exaggeratedly menacing, with a long, powerful snout lined with teeth like sharpened daggers. The most haunting features are its eyes: two large, luminous silver orbs that glow with an unnerving, internal light in the darkness, devoid of pupils and expressing only a frantic, sensory-overloaded panic. It holds itself in a constant state of high alert, muscles coiled, head perpetually swiveling as it is tortured by the sounds of the modern world.
**Environment:** The same containment pen, now far too small. The wolf's black fur absorbs the light, making the space feel dark and claustrophobic.

**Character:** The Night Howler Wolf: A monstrous, genetically engineered aberration of a prehistoric predator, standing as tall as a four-story building at the shoulder. Its form is a terrifying fusion of impossible size and predatory grace. Its fur is a uniform, light-absorbing pitch black, so dark it appears as a void in the night, with no markings or variations. Its body is lean but powerfully muscled, built for explosive speed, with elongated limbs ending in massive paws tipped with obsidian-black claws capable of shredding steel. Its head is lupine but exaggeratedly menacing, with a long, powerful snout lined with teeth like sharpened daggers. The most haunting features are its eyes: two large, luminous silver orbs that glow with an unnerving, internal light in the darkness, devoid of pupils and expressing only a frantic, sensory-overloaded panic. It holds itself in a constant state of high alert, muscles coiled, head perpetually swiveling as it is tortured by the sounds of the modern world.

**Scene 51 — The Containment Zone**
**Camera Style:** A wide shot from a control room monitor showing a schematic of the tunnels. A red dot (the wolf) closes in on a green dot (Kong) inside a designated "containment zone."
**Character:** Dr. Evelyn Sharpe: A woman in her late 30s with a sharp, bird-like intensity. She has a slender, almost frail build, but carries herself with a rigid, obsessive focus that makes her seem formidable. Her face is angular, with high cheekbones and a pointed chin, framed by dark, unruly hair often tied back in a messy but functional knot, with stray strands escaping to frame her face. Her most striking feature is her eyes—a piercing, intelligent grey, wide and unblinking behind thin-framed glasses, constantly analyzing and processing everything around her. She wears practical, high-end lab attire: a dark turtleneck sweater under a pristine white lab coat, its pockets bulging with data pads and pens. Her posture is perpetually hunched forward, as if leaning into her work, and her hands are always moving—gesturing, typing on a holographic interface, or nervously adjusting her glasses.
**Environment:** The command center.
**Action:** Sharpe watches the monitor, her hand hovering over a large red button. "He's in the zone," Reyes confirms. Sharpe takes a deep breath and nods. "Activate the dampeners."

**Scene 52 — Cornered**
**Camera Style:** A dramatic wide shot inside a massive junction chamber in the tunnels. Kong turns to face the charging wolf.
**Character:** King Kong: An immense, primordial ape titan standing over 300 feet tall, a living mountain of muscle and ancient fury. His body is a colossal tapestry of thick, matted fur, ranging in color from deep charcoal to weathered, battle-scarred brown, with swaths of grey across his powerful chest and grizzled jawline. His face is a mask of noble intelligence and profound weariness, dominated by a heavy brow ridge that casts deep shadows over his amber-brown eyes—eyes that hold the wisdom of ages and a flicker of simmering rage. A network of jagged, pale scars crisscrosses his chest and arms, each a testament to a lifetime of defending his domain. He moves with the deliberate, ground-shaking gravity of a force of nature, his posture upright and proud, yet perpetually burdened by the weight of his role as a lonely guardian.
The Night Howler Wolf: A monstrous, genetically engineered aberration of a prehistoric predator, standing as tall as a four-story building at the shoulder. Its form is a terrifying fusion of impossible size and predatory grace. Its fur is a uniform, light-absorbing pitch black, so dark it appears as a void in the night, with no markings or variations. Its body is lean but powerfully muscled, built for explosive speed, with elongated limbs ending in massive paws tipped with obsidian-black claws capable of shredding steel. Its head is lupine but exaggeratedly menacing, with a long, powerful snout lined with teeth like sharpened daggers. The most haunting features are its eyes: two large, luminous silver orbs that glow with an unnerving, internal light in the darkness, devoid of pupils and expressing only a frantic, sensory-overloaded panic. It holds itself in a constant state of high alert, muscles coiled, head perpetually swiveling as it is tortured by the sounds of the modern world.
**Environment:** The vast, circular junction chamber, where several tunnels meet. A huge concrete pillar stands in the center.
**Action:** Kong braces himself, catches the leaping wolf, and uses its own momentum to slam it hard against the central concrete pillar, pinning it.
