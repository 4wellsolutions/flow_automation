**Character:** The Frost Mammoth: An immense, ancient behemoth, even larger and heavier than Kong. Its body is a mountain of prehistoric muscle, supported by four pillar-like legs that end in enormous, snow-crushing feet. Its back is high and arched, sloping down towards its powerful hindquarters. Its entire body is covered in a thick, shaggy coat of pristine white fur, intermixed with longer, ice-crusted guard hairs that hang like a crystalline veil. Two colossal tusks, carved from what looks like living glacier ice, curve menacingly upwards and outwards from its jaw, their tips sharpened to deadly points. Its eyes are a piercing, glacial blue, glowing with an internal, cold light, and are often clouded with a haze of pain and confusion. A faint, glowing frost-like energy seems to emanate from its skin. Its breath visibly freezes the air around it in crystalline patterns.
**Environment:** A vast, fractured Arctic drilling site. Wreckage of machinery is strewn everywhere. The sky is a chaotic swirl of snow and ice shards. The lighting is harsh and blue.
**Action:** The Frost Mammoth erupts from the ice, a cataclysm of frost and fury. It throws its massive head back and unleashes a world-shaking bellow.

**Character:** Dr. Noah Briggs: A man in his late 40s with a lean, wiry build, honed by years of fieldwork rather than gym sessions. He's of average height but carries himself with an intensity that makes him seem taller. His face is weathered, with crow's feet around his sharp, intelligent grey eyes that are constantly observing and analyzing. He has short, salt-and-pepper hair, often disheveled from wind or stress. A thin, faded scar runs along his jawline from a past expedition gone wrong. He wears practical, high-tech arctic gear over a simple thermal base layer. A multi-tool is always clipped to his belt, and a rugged, data-chipped tablet is never far from his hand. He wears thick-rimmed glasses that he frequently pushes up his nose when deep in thought. He has a restless energy, often pacing or gesturing with his hands as he explains complex theories. His posture is alert and focused, leaning into conversations and computer screens with an academic's intensity, but he stands firm and resolute when defending his principles or the titans he studies.
**Environment:** The cramped, claustrophobic interior of a drilling control hub. Monitors flicker with data, the air hums with the sound of generators, and the metallic walls are covered in frost.

**Scene 39 — The Final Hold**
**Camera Style:** A low-angle, 360-degree orbital shot that circles the two grappling titans. The camera moves fluidly, capturing the immense strain and power as Kong wrestles the Mammoth's head down.
**Character:** King Kong: Colossal and powerfully built, his frame a monument of dense muscle and primeval strength. He stands over 300 feet tall, with a broad, barrel chest and immensely long arms that can both deliver devastating blows and carry him with surprising agility. His fur is a thick, dark brown, matted with old scars and weathered by the elements of Skull Island. His face is dominated by a heavy brow, deep-set, intelligent brown eyes that can shift from gentle curiosity to righteous fury in an instant, and a powerful jawline. A network of faint, silvery scars crisscrosses his chest and shoulders, testaments to countless battles fought and won. He wears no attire; his body is his armor. He holds himself with the weary gravitas of an ancient king.
The Frost Mammoth: An apocalyptic beast of staggering size, even larger than Kong in sheer mass. Its body is a mountain of thick muscle and blubber, designed for surviving primordial ice ages. Covered in a dense coat of snowy white fur, matted with ice and dirt, that shimmers with an internal, pale blue light. Its face is dominated by two colossal tusks, curved like glacial sickles and etched with ancient patterns, sharp enough to shatter steel. Its eyes are a piercing, frigid blue, glowing with a painful, confused energy. A constant, visible aura of freezing mist emanates from its body. Its trunk is thick and prehensile, capable of both delicate manipulation and destructive force. A significant, jagged, crystalline scar marks its chest where the drill pierced its heart chamber.
**Environment:** The epicenter of the frozen city. The ground is a treacherous sheet of ice, littered with the wreckage of their battle.
**Action:** Kong dodges a swing of the Mammoth's tusks and dives in, grabbing them. With a titanic effort, he uses his leverage and immense upper body strength to force the Mammoth's head down. The Mammoth struggles, its powerful legs churning, but Kong holds on, muscles straining, roaring in pure exertion. He forces the gigantic creature onto its front knees, pinning it to the ground. He holds it there, their faces inches apart, looking into its pained eyes.
**Mood/Expression:** The ultimate test of strength, a desperate act of violent mercy.
**Audio:** A symphony of titanic roars, the grinding of tusk against bone, the cracking of ice under immense pressure.

Its entire body is covered in a thick, shaggy coat of pristine white fur, intermixed with longer, icicle-like strands that clatter and chime with its movements. Two colossal tusks, carved from what looks like living glacial ice, curve menacingly from its powerful jaw, their tips sharpened to a deadly point. Its eyes are deep-set and glow with a cold, pale blue light, reflecting an ageless sorrow and unimaginable pain. A visible, frosty aura constantly emanates from its body, and its breath is a visible cloud of freezing mist. A deep, jagged wound from the drilling is visible on its chest, pulsing with a faint, cold light.
**Environment:** A vast cavern of ancient blue ice deep beneath the Arctic surface. The drilling rig is a tiny metal insect perched above. Ethereal light filters through the ice, illuminating the perfectly preserved form of the Mammoth.
**Action:** The massive, leathery eyelid, covered in a thin film of 40,000-year-old frost, twitches. A deep, seismic rumble begins to vibrate through the cavern. The ice around the Mammoth begins to crack, not from the drill, but from within the beast itself. The eyelid slowly, painfully, peels open, revealing a colossal eyeball glowing with a pale, cold blue light.

**Action:** Noah shoves his tablet into the General's view. "You don't understand! It's not attacking the city, it's trying to save itself! We destroyed its heart, its internal regulator. It's in constant, agonizing pain from the cold. It's drawn to heat sources—power plants, buildings—trying to find relief!" The General scoffs, but Noah grabs his arm, his eyes blazing with desperate conviction. "Every heat rocket you fire is like throwing salt on an open wound. You're just making it angrier!"
**Mood/Expression:** Desperate, urgent pleading against skeptical military doctrine.
**Audio:** The tense dialogue, the background chaos from comms chatter, the low, distant rumble of the Mammoth.


**Scene 49 — The Last Resort**
**Camera Style:** A wide, static shot of a "war room" table. The camera is positioned at the head of the table, looking down its length at the exhausted faces of generals and government officials. The lighting is harsh and top-down, creating deep shadows.
**Environment:** A sterile, underground government bunker. Maps and satellite images of the frozen city cover the walls. The air is thick with failure.
**Action:** The lead General slams his fist on the table, rattling coffee cups. "Thermobarics failed. Cryo-weapons made it stronger. We've lost the entire downtown core." He leans forward, his voice a low growl of defeat. "We can't kill it. We can't stop it." He looks around the table at the defeated faces. A long, heavy silence hangs in the air before he says, "Only a titan can stop a titan." Another official looks up, whispering the name with a mix of awe and terror: "Kong."

The Frost Mammoth: An ancient titan of truly staggering proportions, even larger than Kong in sheer bulk. Its body is a mountain of prehistoric muscle and bone, built to withstand the crushing pressure of glaciers. Its legs are like colossal pillars, and its back is a vast, sloping expanse of white. Its entire body is covered in a thick, shaggy coat of pristine white fur, intermixed with longer, icicle-like strands that clatter and chime with its movements. Two colossal tusks, carved from what looks like living glacial ice, curve menacingly from its powerful jaw, their tips sharpened to a deadly point. Its eyes are deep-set and glow with a cold, pale blue light, reflecting an ageless sorrow and unimaginable pain. A visible, frosty aura constantly emanates from its body, and its breath is a visible cloud of freezing mist. A deep, jagged wound from the drilling is visible on its chest, pulsing with a faint, cold light.

**Action:** The two titans stare each other down across the plaza. The Mammoth trumpets a challenge born of pain. Kong answers with a ground-shaking roar of a guardian. He drops into a low, predatory stance. The Mammoth lowers its head, aiming its icy tusks. They both charge.
**Mood/Expression:** The calm before the storm. Awe, dread, and the promise of cataclysmic violence.
**Audio:** The Mammoth's mournful trumpet, Kong's defiant roar, and then only the sound of their thunderous footfalls as they charge.


**Scene 55 — Frostbite Fist**
**Camera Style:** A low-angle, slow-motion shot tracking Kong's fist as he swings. The camera follows the punch all the way to impact on the Mammoth's massive flank. The focus is on the textures: Kong's furred knuckles and the Mammoth's icy, shaggy hide.
**Character:** King Kong: A colossal ape of immense size and power, standing well over 300 feet tall. His build is a perfect synthesis of raw brawn and startling agility, with a massive chest, broad shoulders, and long, powerful arms that can shatter mountains. His musculature is dense and clearly defined beneath his fur, showcasing a lifetime of brutal combat and survival. His fur is a deep, earthy brown, matted and coarse, adorned with a constellation of ancient scars that map his history of battles. His face is weathered and intelligent, framed by a thick, almost regal mane of darker fur. His eyes are the most striking feature: a deep, soulful amber that can shift in an instant from profound sadness to savage, incandescent fury. His brow is heavy, his jaw powerful, and his canines are formidable weapons. He wears no attire but carries the marks of his kingdom on his body. Occasionally, he might wield a massive, sharpened stone axe or a giant tree trunk as an improvised weapon. He holds himself with the weight of a lonely god, a guardian king. His posture is often a thoughtful, hunched stance, but in battle, he rises to his full, terrifying height, a picture of primal dominance. He moves with a purpose that is both deliberate and explosive.
The Frost Mammoth: An ancient titan of truly staggering proportions, even larger than Kong in sheer bulk. Its body is a mountain of prehistoric muscle and bone, built to withstand the crushing pressure of glaciers. Its legs are like colossal pillars, and its back is a vast, sloping expanse of white. Its entire body is covered in a thick, shaggy coat of pristine white fur, intermixed with longer, icicle-like strands that clatter and chime with its movements. Two colossal tusks, carved from what looks like living glacial ice, curve menacingly from its powerful jaw, their tips sharpened to a deadly point. Its eyes are deep-set and glow with a cold, pale blue light, reflecting an ageless sorrow and unimaginable pain. A visible, frosty aura constantly emanates from its body, and its breath is a visible cloud of freezing mist. A deep, jagged wound from the drilling is visible on its chest, pulsing with a faint, cold light.
**Environment:** The icy plaza, now being torn apart by the titans' collision.
**Action:** Kong and the Mammoth collide with the force of an extinction event. A shockwave of snow and ice explodes outwards. Kong sidesteps a tusk swing and plants a titanic right hook into the Mammoth's side. The impact is thunderous, but as he pulls his fist back, he roars in pain. A layer of crystalline frost covers his knuckles, burning his skin like fire. He looks at his fist in shock.
**Mood/Expression:** Brutal, visceral impact, followed by a shocking discovery of the enemy's power.

He's not physically imposing, but he carries himself with an academic's intensity and the resilience of someone who has spent years in harsh field environments. His face is sharp and intelligent, with crow's feet around his keen, inquisitive blue eyes that betray a deep empathy. His hair is a salt-and-pepper mix, perpetually windswept and unkempt. A thin, faded scar cuts across his left eyebrow from a past expedition accident. He has a thoughtful, often worried expression, his brow furrowed in concentration. Typically wears functional, high-tech arctic gear: a heavy-duty, dark blue parka with a fur-lined hood, insulated trousers, and thermal boots. He is rarely seen without a ruggedized tablet clutched in his hands, displaying complex data streams and biometric readings.
**Environment:** The cramped, vibrating interior of an APC. Red emergency lights flash. Through the armored viewport, the chaotic battle is visible in flashes.
**Action:** The decryption software finally breaks the last layer of code from the Mammoth's DNA vault. Ancient symbols and biological diagrams flash across the screen. Noah's eyes go wide. He sees images of the Mammoth species working in concert with the planet's climate cycles, preventing overheating. He sees pictograms of Kong's ancestors fighting alongside them. He whispers, his voice filled with awe and horror, "My God... It's not a monster. It's a guardian. A planetary stabilizer. If it dies... we all die."
**Mood/Expression:** A revelation of cosmic significance amidst immediate, life-threatening chaos.
**Audio:** The rumble of the APC, the distant roars and crashes of the titan fight, the fast, triumphant chime of the decryption program finishing.

**Environment:** The APC, racing towards the battle. A large, cylindrical device—the temperature harmonizer—is strapped down in the center of the cabin.
**Action:** "We can't kill it! We have to save it!" Noah yells over the noise. He points to the harmonizer. "This device was meant to measure geothermal energy. I can repurpose it to stabilize the Mammoth's internal temperature, end its pain!" Diaz looks at him like he's insane. "And how do you plan on getting that close?" Noah looks out the viewport at Kong, who is now roaring in defiance at the Mammoth. "He has to hold it down for us. Kong has to hold it down."
**Mood/Expression:** A race against time. A desperate, high-stakes gamble.
**Audio:** Shouted, frantic dialogue, the scream of the APC's engine, the continuous boom of the fight outside.

**Camera Style:** A low-angle shot, looking up from the shattered drilling rig. The camera uses a wide, distorted lens to emphasize the scale as the Mammoth bursts free. It shakes violently, simulating the tremor, then crash-zooms onto the Mammoth’s glowing blue eye as it fully opens.
**Character:** The Frost Mammoth: A colossal beast, significantly taller and bulkier than Kong, a living mountain of muscle and ancient ice. Covered in thick, snowy-white fur matted with frost and ancient grime, its skin underneath is tough, leathery, and grey like a glacier's face. Two immense, curving tusks, made of a substance resembling permafrost-infused ivory, arc upwards and outwards, each as long as a bus and sharp enough to shatter steel. Its eyes are small in its massive head, deep-set and glowing with a faint, pained, cryogenic blue light. Its trunk is a powerful, prehensile weapon, ending in two thick, finger-like projections. Its breath manifests as a visible, swirling vortex of super-chilled air and ice crystals. Remnants of the drilling equipment—shards of metal and cables—are embedded near its heart, a constant source of agony. It moves with a lumbering, unstoppable gait, each footstep a tremor, its posture one of perpetual agony and confusion.
**Environment:** The Arctic drilling site is in ruins. A massive chasm splits the ice, spewing frost and steam. Twisted metal from the rig lies everywhere.

**Character:** King Kong: A towering ape of immense power, his frame a perfect fusion of brute strength and surprising agility. His fur is a deep, dark brown, almost black, with streaks of grey and silver across his back and chest. His face is expressive, with a heavy brow, a wide, powerful jaw, and deep, intelligent amber-brown eyes that convey a range of emotions from contemplative sorrow to righteous fury. Scars crisscross his body, most notably a series of deep claw marks across his chest. He wears a large, crude leather bracer on his right forearm. He stands with the proud, regal bearing of a king, his posture upright and vigilant.
**Environment:** A storm-lashed clearing on Skull Island. Unnatural snow falls, mixing with the tropical rain. The ground is muddy. Behind Kong, the dark, menacing jungle looms. A portable, ruggedized projector screen is set up, flickering in the gloom.
**Action:** Kong kneels, his massive form hunched as he watches the projected footage of the Frost Mammoth’s rampage. His amber-brown eyes are fixed on the images of fleeing families and frozen landscapes. When Noah's voice reveals humans caused this, Kong’s expression hardens.

It moves with a lumbering, unstoppable gait, each footstep a tremor, its posture one of perpetual agony and confusion.
**Environment:** The shattered city street, now a canyon of broken buildings and treacherous ice.
**Action:** The Mammoth blasts a wave of freezing breath. Kong, anticipating it, vaults behind the pillar of a skyscraper. The ice blast hits the concrete, shattering it. Kong rips a massive I-beam from the wreckage, roaring as he charges. He doesn't strike the Mammoth's body but slams the beam against its massive foreleg, trying to buckle its knee. The Mammoth stumbles, trumpeting in rage, and tries to gore him. Kong dodges, using his superior agility to get in close, avoiding the deadly tusks.
**Mood/Expression:** Strategic, intelligent combat. Kong is no longer trying to kill, but to subdue.
**Audio:** The sharp WHOOSH of the ice breath, the groaning tear of metal, the clang of the I-beam on bone, and the furious roars and trumpets of the titans.


**Scene 69 — The Hold**
**Camera Style:** An extreme low-angle shot from the ground, looking up at the two titans locked in a struggle. The camera is locked down, emphasizing their immense weight and the sheer effort involved. Slow-motion is used as Kong finally forces the Mammoth down.
**Character:**
- King Kong: A towering ape of immense power, his frame a perfect fusion of brute strength and surprising agility. His fur is a deep, dark brown, almost black, with streaks of grey and silver across his back and chest. His face is expressive, with a heavy brow, a wide, powerful jaw, and deep, intelligent amber-brown eyes that convey a range of emotions from contemplative sorrow to righteous fury. Scars crisscross his body, most notably a series of deep claw marks across his chest. He wears a large, crude leather bracer on his right forearm. He stands with the proud, regal bearing of a king, his posture upright and vigilant.
- The Frost Mammoth: A colossal beast, significantly taller and bulkier than Kong, a living mountain of muscle and ancient ice. Covered in thick, snowy-white fur matted with frost and ancient grime, its skin underneath is tough, leathery, and grey like a glacier's face. Two immense, curving tusks, made of a substance resembling permafrost-infused ivory, arc upwards and outwards, each as long as a bus and sharp enough to shatter steel. Its eyes are small in its massive head, deep-set and glowing with a faint, pained, cryogenic blue light. Its trunk is a powerful, prehensile weapon, ending in two thick, finger-like projections. Its breath manifests as a visible, swirling vortex of super-chilled air and ice crystals. Remnants of the drilling equipment—shards of metal and cables—are embedded near its heart, a constant source of agony. It moves with a lumbering, unstoppable gait, each footstep a tremor, its posture one of perpetual agony and confusion.
**Environment:** A destroyed intersection. The ground is a cratered mix of ice, asphalt, and twisted steel.
**Action:** Kong has managed to get on the Mammoth's back. He grabs its immense, curving tusks, his muscles straining to the breaking point. The Mammoth thrashes wildly, trying to throw him off. With a final, monumental effort, Kong uses all his weight and strength, roaring as he wrenches the Mammoth's head downwards. The Mammoth's front legs buckle, and it crashes to its knees with a ground-shaking thud. Kong holds it there, pinning the struggling titan as he roars towards Noah's position: "NOW!"
**Mood/Expression:** Straining, climactic, desperate exertion.
**Audio:** The tortured groans of both titans, the scraping of ivory against Kong's hands, the final, earth-shattering THUD as the Mammoth falls to its knees. Kong's guttural, demanding roar.


**Scene 70 — A Moment of Peace**
**Camera Style:** Starts with an extreme close-up on the Temperature Harmonizer as a green light activates. The camera then slowly pulls back to a wide, static, high-angle shot, showing the two titans collapsed near each other in the now-quiet city. The movement is slow and deliberate, creating a sense of peace and resolution.

**Environment:** The wrecked city intersection. The heavy blizzard subsides into a gentle snowfall. A faint hint of morning sun begins to break through the clouds, causing the ice to gleam.
**Action:** A beam of warm, golden light emits from the Harmonizer, enveloping the Mammoth. The creature shudders violently one last time, letting out a final, pained cry that softens into a low, resonant groan. The piercing cryogenic blue glow in its eyes fades to a calm, dark grey. Its massive body relaxes, its head slumping to the ground. Exhausted, Kong lets go of the tusks and collapses onto his side a few yards away, breathing heavily. The two ancient titans lie still, not as enemies, but as two weary survivors. The city around them slowly begins to thaw.
**Mood/Expression:** Exhausted relief, tranquility, and a fragile peace.
**Audio:** The high-pitched hum of the device, which fades. The Mammoth's final cry turning into a gentle exhalation. The sound of Kong's heavy, tired breathing. The faint sound of dripping water as the ice begins to melt.
