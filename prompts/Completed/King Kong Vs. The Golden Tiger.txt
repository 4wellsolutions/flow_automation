Her dark brown hair is tied back in a practical ponytail. She wears functional archaeological field attire. She sketches in a notebook, looking awestruck. Her father, Professor Alaric Thorne, an ambitious man in his late 60s with sharp features, silver-grey hair, and piercing blue eyes, directs a team with a winch, his khaki expedition gear immaculate.

Mood/Expression: Tense, claustrophobic discovery. The weight of ancient history is palpable.
