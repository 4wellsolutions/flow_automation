Scene 10: The object crashes, not in a fiery explosion, but with a wet, sickening thud, creating a dark, muddy crater.
Scene 11: From the crater, a thick, viscous, glowing purple liquid begins to ooze, like bioluminescent waste, starkly contrasting with the green jungle.
Scene 12: The unnatural purple liquid seeps from new cracks in the nearby rocks, as if the mountain itself is bleeding poison.
