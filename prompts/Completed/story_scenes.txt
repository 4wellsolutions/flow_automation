Scene 1 — Justification**
**Camera Style:** A tight, sterile close-up on Dr. Farid Khan's determined face, reflected in a polished boardroom table. The camera slowly dollies back to reveal the room, using a wide-angle lens to create a sense of clinical isolation and pressure.
**Character:** Dr. Lira: Slender, with a wiry strength that suggests long hours and nervous energy rather than athletic prowess. Sharp, intelligent features framed by dark, unruly hair often pulled back in a hasty knot. Her eyes are a deep, expressive brown, currently shadowed by sleeplessness and a profound, gnawing guilt. She has a nervous habit of rubbing a faint scar on her left thumb. Initially, a sterile, white lab coat over practical, dark trousers and a simple blouse. Her posture is often tense, shoulders hunched as if carrying a physical weight. She moves with a quick, decisive gait that betrays a mind constantly racing, wrestling with the consequences of her actions.
**Environment:** A sterile, minimalist boardroom at dawn. Gleaming chrome surfaces, a single holographic display showing genetic sequencing, and floor-to-ceiling windows revealing a hazy sunrise over a modern research complex.
**Action:** Dr. Farid Khan, sharp and ambitious, points a laser at the holographic display. Dr. Lira stands, her hands flat on the table, her knuckles white. She shakes her head, her deep brown eyes flashing with protest. “We can’t abduct a cub, Farid. It’s a monstrous line to cross.” Farid dismisses her with a wave. “We will save millions, Lira. One risk is justified.”
**Mood/Expression:** Tense, clinical ambition clashing with moral dread.
**Audio:** The low hum of the building's climate control. Farid’s sharp, confident voice. Lira’s strained, quiet protest.

**Character:** Karim, a security contractor with a hardened, unreadable face, expertly assembles the sonic injector. Sofia, a young lab tech, watches with wide, fearful eyes.
**Environment:** A dimly lit logistics bay. Cages of equipment line the walls. The air smells of ozone and oiled metal.
**Action:** Karim clicks the sonic injector's power cell into place with a definitive snap. He explains its function in a low monotone: “Experimental. Temporarily paralyzes large fauna. No blood loss, minimal tissue damage.” Sofia flinches as he powers it on, a barely audible hum filling the room.
**Mood/Expression:** Cold, methodical preparation. A sense of impending violation.
**Audio:** The sharp click of metal parts locking together. The low, sub-sonic hum of the injector. Karim's dispassionate voice.

**


Scene 3 — A Mother’s Doubt**

Sharp, intelligent features framed by dark, unruly hair often pulled back in a hasty knot. Her eyes are a deep, expressive brown, currently shadowed by sleeplessness and a profound, gnawing guilt. She has a nervous habit of rubbing a faint scar on her left thumb. Initially, a sterile, white lab coat over practical, dark trousers and a simple blouse. Her posture is often tense, shoulders hunched as if carrying a physical weight. She moves with a quick, decisive gait that betrays a mind constantly racing, wrestling with the consequences of her actions.
**Environment:** A sterile corridor outside the logistics bay. The harsh fluorescent lighting casts long, distorted shadows.
**Action:** Lira pauses, her back to the others. She pulls out the drawing—a child's crayon sketch of two tigers—and looks at it for a long moment. Her face is a mask of conflict. She rubs the faint scar on her thumb, then quickly hides the drawing and forces herself to walk towards the exit.
**Mood/Expression:** Deepening remorse and personal conflict.
**Audio:** The distant, muffled sounds of the team preparing. Lira’s unsteady breath. The faint crinkle of paper.

His pristine white fur gleams ethereally under the moonlight, accented by faint, ghostly black stripes. His piercing ice-blue eyes are closed in sleep, but his massive head and paws, the size of small boulders, convey immense, dormant power.

His demeanor is one of agonizing powerlessness.
**Environment:** The moonlit river clearing. The peace is shattered.
**Action:** The tiger's ice-blue eyes snap open, but they are unfocused. A low, pained groan escapes his throat. He tries to rise, his colossal frame shuddering, but his powerful limbs refuse to obey, twitching and scrabbling against the damp earth.
**Mood/Expression:** Disturbing, agonizing powerlessness.
**Audio:** The deep, pained groan. The intensifying sub-sonic hum. The sound of claws scraping dirt.

His pristine white fur is matted with mud. His piercing ice-blue eyes are sharp and focused, burning with grief and purpose. His demeanor is one of relentless, grim determination.
**Environment:** The violated clearing at dawn. The ground is torn up. A single, small cub-sized depression in the dirt is all that remains.

**Environment:** The edge of the jungle, where the team's vehicle departed. The air smells of diesel fumes and the faint chemical residue of the sonic injector.
**Action:** The father ignores all natural scents. His intelligence is visible as he connects the dots: the foreign smells, the tire tracks, the artificial fiber. He lifts his head, lets out a low, determined growl, and begins to follow the trail, his powerful limbs eating up the ground.
**Mood/Expression:** Cold, intelligent fury. The hunt has begun.
**Audio:** The tiger's low growl. The soft squelch of his massive paws in the mud.

**Environment:** A wide, multi-lane city avenue. Police barricades are scattered like toys.
**Action:** A high-voltage net is fired, draping over the tiger. He roars, and with a single flex of his colossal muscles, snaps the thick cables. Tranquilizer rockets hit his flank, and he barely seems to notice, shaking them off like flies.
**Mood/Expression:** Frustration and the terrifying failure of human technology.
**Audio:** The thwump-thwump of helicopter blades. The ineffective *pings* of tranquilizer darts. The crackle of electricity followed by the snap of breaking steel. The tiger's enraged roar.

**Environment:** The safehouse basement, now illuminated by a portable medical lamp.
