Style of Video: undefined
Duration: 9 sec

Scene 9 — The Dragon's Birth
Camera Style: A dramatic, low-angle shot from the rim of the volcano's new maw, looking into the heart of the eruption.
Character: The Fire Dragon (Ignis) (A primordial elemental sovereign. A colossal, serpentine creature formed from incandescent, molten magma and jagged, obsidian-black rock. It has no eyes, only a gaping maw that radiates blinding white heat. Its body constantly drips and reforms, leaving a trail of liquid fire).
Environment: The newly formed, gaping crater atop Mount Cinder.
Action: A torrent of incandescent magma erupts, but it doesn't flow. It hangs in the air, defying gravity, before coalescing with impossible speed.

Camera Style: An extreme close-up on Ignis's "skin."
Character: The Fire Dragon (Ignis).
Environment: The peak of Mount Cinder.
Action: The camera pushes in on Ignis's body. It is not flesh, but a flowing river of magma contained within a shell of constantly breaking and reforming obsidian plates. A tree, uprooted by the eruption, touches its flank and is not merely burned, but *unmade*—it melts and is absorbed into Ignis's molten form, becoming part of the creature. This is not a biological monster; it is a geological event given horrifying form and purpose.
Mood/Expression: Unsettling, unnatural, and deeply threatening. It reinforces that this creature cannot be fought by conventional means.
Audio: A low, constant, bubbling and cracking sound, like a mobile lava field. A sickening *slurp* as the tree is absorbed.
