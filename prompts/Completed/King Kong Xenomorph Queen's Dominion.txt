Action: A tiny, almost invisible glint of metal is visible on the island's surface—the APEX drilling rig. From the rig, a deep, sub-sonic vibration emanates, creating concentric ripples in the jungle canopy, like a stone dropped in a pond. The camera begins a slow, ominous push-in, descending through the clouds towards this point of disturbance.

Action: King Kong sits on his natural throne, surveying his kingdom. He is still, like a statue carved from the mountain itself. His head suddenly lifts, nostrils flaring. He turns his gaze towards the jungle far below, his brow furrowed. He has heard the unnatural hum.
Mood/Expression: Regal, weary, and disturbed. A king sensing a deep wrongness.

He wears a grease-stained APEX engineering jumpsuit).
Environment: The cramped, metal-walled APEX drilling control room. Monitors flash red alerts, and steam vents from ruptured pipes. The entire room shakes violently.
Action: Dr. Anya Sharma grips a console, watching a drill-head schematic on a flickering CRT monitor. The depth gauge skyrockets past its safety limits before the screen fills with static. Davis shouts over the alarms as a final, catastrophic shudder throws him against a wall. The main monitor displays "SIGNAL LOST." Then, silence.
Mood/Expression: Tense, chaotic, and technologically overwhelmed. The moment of catastrophic discovery.

Action: The camera pushes past the broken drill head and into the vast chamber. The sheer scale is revealed. As the camera glides over the field of pods, the leathery top of the one closest to the lens slowly peels open with a wet, sickening sound, disturbed by the breach.
Mood/Expression: Pure cosmic horror. The feeling of stumbling into an ancient, malevolent tomb.
Audio: The J-Cut of Kong's low growl from Scene 2 transitions into the faint, high-pitched CHITTERING that seems to emanate from the cavern itself. A wet, tearing sound as the Ovomorph opens.

Action: Kong arrives at the source of the disturbance. He cautiously approaches the wrecked facility, his head low, sniffing the air. He recoils slightly, a look of disgust on his face. He places a hand on a wall coated in the alien resin, then pulls it back, a low growl rumbling in his chest.
Mood/Expression: Tense, investigative, and deeply unsettling. The calm before the storm.
Audio: A tense silence, broken only by the dripping of the black resin and the low, suspicious growl from Kong. The wind whistles through the torn metal.

This is her true purpose.
Mood/Expression: Shocking, grotesque, and horrifying. The ultimate trump card revealed.
