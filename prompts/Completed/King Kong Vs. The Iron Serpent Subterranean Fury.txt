Action: A coffee mug sitting on a rickety metal table begins to vibrate gently. A fine layer of dust on the table's surface dances in concentric rings.

Action: Marc traces a line on the blueprint with a calloused finger, his brow furrowed. He's ignoring the chaotic chatter from a radio. He taps a specific, deep-level junction on the map, a place long-decommissioned. He knows these tremors aren't natural. His experience tells him something is fundamentally wrong.
