Character: N/A.
Environment: Deep within the Sacred Forest, miles from the logging.
Action: As the distant tree impacts the ground (unseen), a visible ripple of energy, like a heat haze, travels through the forest floor. The vibrant green moss in the foreground instantly turns a sickly, necrotic black. A single, perfect dewdrop on a leaf trembles and then turns dark and oily. The life force is visibly draining from the immediate area.
Mood/Expression: Unsettling, supernatural, and ominous. A subtle sign of a deep, spiritual wound.
Audio: The distant, bone-jarring THOOM of the tree's impact, followed by an unnatural, high-pitched ringing sound and a low, guttural moan that seems to emanate from the earth itself.

Action: The camera pans nervously across the camp. In the deep shadows between machinery, a darker, formless shadow seems to detach from the others. It moves with an unnatural fluidity, stretching and contracting in ways that defy physics. It's there for a moment, then gone, leaving only the feeling of being watched.
Mood/Expression: Eerie, unsettling, and paranoid. The atmosphere is thick with dread.
Audio: The low growl of a diesel generator, the chirping of crickets abruptly going silent, and a faint, mournful whisper carried on the wind that sounds like a sigh of immense sadness.

Character: Dr. Mara Rostova, a sharp woman in her late 30s with dark hair pulled into a tight bun and intense, focused eyes. She wears a practical, khaki field jacket over a simple blouse and cargo pants. She steps out of the jeep, her face a mask of professional determination mixed with visible apprehension.
Environment: The Apex logging camp, now eerily silent and shrouded in a thick, unnatural fog. The only light comes from the jeep's headlights, which cut feeble paths into the gloom.
Action: Mara gets out of her jeep, holding a large, heavy-duty flashlight. She sweeps its beam across the silent, monolithic machinery. The beam catches on the strange, black ooze dripping from a hydraulic line, and she takes a cautious step forward to investigate.
Mood/Expression: Investigative, tense, and mysterious. A classic "detective at a crime scene" feeling, but on a massive scale.
Audio: The crunch of gravel under Mara's boots, the sound of the jeep's engine idling, and the oppressive, heavy silence of the dead forest.
Style of Video: Cinematic, atmospheric, 8K. 'David Fincher' style suspense, using light and shadow to create a sense of dread.
Duration: 10 sec

Scene 9 — The Central Grove
Camera Style: A slow, reverent dolly shot moving forward through the now-decimated central grove of the forest.
Character: N/A.

Action: The camera drifts over the unbelievable destruction. This was the site of the most sacred tree, the "heartwood" of the forest. The ground is littered with the shattered remains of what Apex Resources destroyed. The shot establishes the location of the curse's genesis.
Mood/Expression: Tragic, mournful, and desecrated. The feeling of standing in a graveyard for giants.
Audio: A complete and unnatural silence, broken only by the faint, sad whisper of the wind blowing across the giant stumps.

Environment: The central grove's giant stump.
Action: The black smoke erupts from the stump in a massive, violent plume. It swirls in the air, drawing in dust, leaves, and splinters, coalescing into a titanic, amorphous shape hundreds of feet tall.

Character: The Shadow Bear, a colossal guardian of the Sacred Forest, now a monstrous manifestation of grief and rage. Its form is that of a titanic bear, hundreds of feet tall, composed of tangible, roiling shadow. Wisps of darkness constantly bleed off its body. Its eyes are not eyes, but hollow voids burning with a cold, sorrowful light. Its presence radiates a palpable aura of ancient pain.
Environment: The ruined central grove, now dwarfed by the creature's presence.
Action: The Shadow Bear stands at its full, gargantuan height. It takes a slow, deliberate look at the devastation around it—the stumps of its fallen brethren. It lifts its city-block-sized head to the sky, and its shadowy form seems to solidify for a moment, fueled by pure rage and anguish.

Character: The Shadow Bear, a colossal guardian of the Sacred Forest, now a monstrous manifestation of grief and rage. Its face is a shifting mask of shadow, but the agony within its hollow eyes is unmistakable.
Environment: The ruined central grove.
Action: The Bear's shadowy maw opens wide, impossibly wide, revealing not teeth, but a swirling vortex of deeper darkness within. It unleashes a roar—not of anger, but of pure, world-breaking sorrow. A visible wave of sonic force, shimmering with black energy, erupts from its mouth and blasts outwards.
Mood/Expression: Heartbreaking, terrifying, and bone-chilling. This is the sound of a world's soul dying.

Action: A tank fires a shell with a deafening BOOM. The camera follows the shell as it streaks through the air and flies directly into the chest of the approaching Shadow Bear. Instead of exploding, the shell passes straight through the Bear's shadowy form as if it were smoke, continuing on for a mile before detonating harmlessly. The Bear does not even flinch.
Mood/Expression: Futile, tense, and unnerving. Humanity's weapons are utterly useless against this supernatural threat.
Audio: The sharp KRA-KOOM of the tank firing, the whistle of the shell, and then an anticlimactic, distant explosion. The only sound from the Bear is its low, guttural breathing.

Environment: A small, makeshift museum in a nearby indigenous community's cultural center. The room is filled with artifacts, weavings, and historical photographs.
Action: Mara is looking at a piece of ancient petroglyph—a large, flat stone covered in carvings. Her flashlight illuminates the etchings. The camera pushes past her shoulder to reveal the carvings: a depiction of a massive, benevolent-looking bear, surrounded by thriving trees and happy animals. It is clearly a guardian spirit.
Mood/Expression: Revelatory, somber, and intellectual. A key piece of the puzzle falls into place.

It moves from the image of the benevolent guardian bear to a new set of carvings: small, stick-figure-like shapes wielding axes (humans) cutting down the trees. The next image shows the guardian bear, but now its form is twisted, shadowy, and it is weeping black tears. The final image shows the shadowy bear figure unleashing a wave of darkness upon the stick-figure humans.

Environment: Standing just outside the cultural center, with the spreading blight visible as a dark wall on the horizon.
Action: Mara speaks urgently into the phone, her words getting lost in static. She gestures wildly towards the petroglyphs, then back at the approaching darkness, trying to make an unseen Apex executive understand. "It's not a monster, it's a... a wound! You can't fight it, you're only making it stronger!" Her plea is met with dismissal.
Mood/Expression: Desperate, urgent, and frustrated. The classic "Cassandra" moment where the truth is ignored.
Audio: Mara's desperate voice, the loud crackle and hiss of the satellite phone connection, and the condescending, tinny voice of an executive on the other end saying, "-preciate the local color, Doctor, but our assets will handle it."

Environment: The main street of the evacuated town.
Action: The Shadow Bear takes a slow, deliberate step into the town. Its foot, the size of a building, comes down on the street. It doesn't crush the buildings; its semi-ethereal form passes through them, but as it does, they instantly decay, their paint peeling, wood rotting, and structures groaning as they crumble into dust.
Mood/Expression: Utterly terrifying and surreal. The feeling of being an ant before a careless, sorrowful god.
