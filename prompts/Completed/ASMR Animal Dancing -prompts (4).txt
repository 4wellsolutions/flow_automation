--- **Prompt 2: Vinyl Record Groove** A top-down, slightly angled macro shot focuses intently on a single, deep groove of a pristine, 12-inch vinyl record, spinning gently. Warm, diffused light with a single, focused 'spotlight' beam highlights the specific groove, maintaining a nostalgic, golden-hour hue. The tiny grizzly bear, in full disco regalia (afro wig, leisure suit, platform shoes, gold medallion), is initially curled up, almost imperceptibly, within a single groove of the spinning record. As the record gently spins, it slowly unfurls, pushing its tiny afro-wigged head up, eyes blinking open with a surprisingly serious, yet funky, expression. It then attempts a slow, deliberate 'point' with a minuscule claw. The deep, rhythmic *hum* of the record player, accompanied by the subtle, almost hypnotic *whisper* of the needle tracking the vinyl. As the bear emerges, a delicate, soft *scratching* sound is heard, as if its tiny platform shoe is scuffing the vinyl, followed by a faint, almost inaudible *crinkle* of its leisure suit. ---

Create a hyper-realistic, 3D CGI ASMR video, framed as an extreme macro, top-down perspective, angled subtly to capture the deep, parabolic curve of a single groove on a pristine, jet-black 12-inch vinyl record. The record spins at a slow, mesmerizing 33 1/3 RPM on an unseen turntable, its mirror-like surface reflecting the warm, diffused, golden-hour light that floods the scene. A singular, intensely focused 'spotlight' beam, like a miniature stage light, perfectly illuminates the specific groove, creating dramatic micro-shadows within the vinyl's texture and around the bear.

The tiny grizzly bear, in full disco regalia—a perfectly coiffed miniature afro wig, a shimmering leisure suit, minuscule platform shoes, and a glinting gold medallion—is initially curled into an almost imperceptible, shimmering speck of brown and gold, nestled deep within the vinyl's micro-valley. Its tiny afro wig is perfectly pressed against the groove wall, and the miniature leisure suit fabric appears to almost melt into the vinyl texture.

As the record spins with hypnotic slowness, the bear begins its 'unfurling' ritual. First, a minuscule, gold-medallion-adorned paw twitches, followed by a faint, almost subliminal *rustle* of its tiny leisure suit fabric. Then, slowly, deliberately, its afro-wigged head, surprisingly large for its tiny body, begins to push upwards from the groove, accompanied by a delicate, soft *scuffing* or *gravelly scratch* as its minuscule platform shoe shifts against the vinyl, creating micro-vibrations. Finally, as it pushes its head up, a barely audible, almost 'pop'-like *crackle* or *snap* from its tiny bones as it stretches, followed by a soft, almost imperceptible *puff* of its tiny bear breath. Its eyes, dark and glistening like polished beads, blink open with a comically serious, almost defiant 'funk' expression.

With excruciating slowness, it pushes its tiny form almost upright, the miniature disco ball glinting off its gold medallion. Then, after a moment of intense concentration, it performs a deliberate, slow 'point' with a minuscule, perfectly manicured claw, aiming directly at the camera, as if conducting an invisible disco orchestra.

The powerful ASMR audio track is layered with high-fidelity precision. It features a deep, resonant, almost meditative *hum* emanating from the record player's internal mechanics, mixed with the ever-present, hypnotic *whisper* and delicate *hiss* of the needle meticulously tracking the vinyl, creating a subtle 'whooshing' as the grooves pass. All audio elements are mixed to be crisp, clear, and deeply immersive, designed to create a relaxing, tingling sensation for the viewer.

It features a deep, resonant, almost meditative *hum* emanating from the record player's internal mechanics, mixed with the ever-present, hypnotic *whisper* and delicate *hiss* of the needle meticulously tracking the vinyl, creating a subtle 'whooshing' as the grooves pass. All audio elements are mixed to be crisp, clear, and deeply immersive, designed to create a relaxing, tingling sensation for the viewer.

Create a hyper-realistic, 3D CGI ASMR video, framed as an extreme macro, top-down perspective, angled subtly to capture the deep, parabolic curve of a single groove on a pristine, jet-black 12-inch vinyl record. The record spins at a slow, mesmerizing 33 1/3 RPM on an unseen turntable, its mirror-like surface reflecting the warm, diffused, golden-hour light that floods the scene. A singular, intensely focused 'spotlight' beam, like a miniature stage light, perfectly illuminates the specific groove, creating dramatic micro-shadows within the vinyl's texture and around the bear.

The tiny Clam, in full disco regalia—a perfectly coiffed miniature afro wig, a shimmering leisure suit, minuscule platform shoes, and a glinting gold medallion—is initially curled into an almost imperceptible, shimmering speck of brown and gold, nestled deep within the vinyl's micro-valley. Its tiny afro wig is perfectly pressed against the groove wall, and the miniature leisure suit fabric appears to almost melt into the vinyl texture.

As the record spins with hypnotic slowness, the bear begins its 'unfurling' ritual. First, a minuscule, gold-medallion-adorned paw twitches, followed by a faint, almost subliminal *rustle* of its tiny leisure suit fabric. Then, slowly, deliberately, its afro-wigged head, surprisingly large for its tiny body, begins to push upwards from the groove, accompanied by a delicate, soft *scuffing* or *gravelly scratch* as its minuscule platform shoe shifts against the vinyl, creating micro-vibrations. Finally, as it pushes its head up, a barely audible, almost 'pop'-like *crackle* or *snap* from its tiny bones as it stretches, followed by a soft, almost imperceptible *puff* of its tiny bear breath. Its eyes, dark and glistening like polished beads, blink open with a comically serious, almost defiant 'funk' expression.

With excruciating slowness, it pushes its tiny form almost upright, the miniature disco ball glinting off its gold medallion. Then, after a moment of intense concentration, it performs a deliberate, slow 'point' with a minuscule, perfectly manicured claw, aiming directly at the camera, as if conducting an invisible disco orchestra.
